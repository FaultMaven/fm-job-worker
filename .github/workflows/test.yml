# DEPRECATED: Do not use for routine testing.
# This workflow runs independently from the hardened CI/CD pipeline in ci.yml.
# Use ci.yml which includes build → unit tests → smoke tests → push.
#
# This workflow is kept for emergency scenarios only.
# Trigger manually via workflow_dispatch if needed.
